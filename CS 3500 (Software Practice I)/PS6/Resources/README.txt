	- Started creating the GUI for the Spreadsheet. I know I will need to use the provided SpreadsheetPanel
	  class to save a lot of time. And I will have to implement my Spreadsheet class I created to be the basis
	  of the spradsheet.

	- Implemented a lot of the logic of the spreadsheet, but still need to finish the saving and opening features
	  of the spreadsheet. Additionally, spent around 2 hours implementing a find feature that took longer due to
	  with a ton of find windows opening every time it was called once.
	- It is now later in the day and have finished everything I can see I need to finish. The 2 main additional
	  functionality items I added were the find feature, which although simple, took hours due to bugs relating
	  to many key events that were being rapidly pushed and causing the find event to get called many times, and 
	  pressing enter to set the value of the cell rather than having a button which I had intially. Additionally,
	  I was not able to complete any testing through the recommended UI test methods because it wasn't working on 
	  my laptop and my desktop computer.
