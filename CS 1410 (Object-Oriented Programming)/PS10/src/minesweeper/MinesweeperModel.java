/**
 * Represents the state of a Minesweeper board on which multiple games can be played. The board consists of a
 * rectangular grid of squares in which playing pieces can be placed. Squares are identified by their zero-based row and
 * column numbers, where rows are numbered starting with the bottom row, and columns are numbered by starting from the
 * leftmost column.
 * 
 * Multiple games can be played on a single board. Whenever a new game begins, the board is covered. There is one
 * player. The goal of the game is to uncover all the squares without choosing a mine. The numbers represent how many
 * squares surrounding that square (up to 8) have a mine in it.
 * 
 * A MinesweeperModel also keeps track of the outcomes of the games that have been played on it. It tracks the number of
 * the time and how many mines are left to choose.
